# Crypto

Implementations of cryptographic algorithms in Haskell. So far I have implemented

- Textbook [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))
- [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing)
- [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)

In this project I strive (but do not claim I succeed) to follow these design principles:

- Elegance
- DRY
- KISS
- Narrow interfaces

## How to run

Change directory to `src/` and type `ghci`. Now load the module you want to run. Some modules require the package `MonadRandom`, which you can install with `cabal install MonadRandom`.

## Modules overview

![](misc/modules_overview.png)

### Math

The `Math` module provides discrete mathematics functions used by the cryptographic modules.

- `Divisibility` Divisibility test, Extended Euclidean Algorithm and co.
- `PowerModulo` Modular exponentiation done efficiently.
- `Prime` Primality testing using the Miller-Rabin test.
- `Gen` Generation of coprimes and primes.
- `BigInt` Data types with `Arbitrary` instances giving larger numbers. Used for testing-purposes.

### RSA

Implementation of textbook RSA.

- `Example` Example usage of the RSA library.

### Shamir

Implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing.

- `Example` Example usage of the secret sharing scheme.

### SHA256

Implementation of SHA256. The terminology follows closely to that of the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2).

- `Compression` Inner compression loop.
- `MessageSchedule` Creation of the message schedule array.
- `Constants` Round constants for the compression and initial hash values for the Merkle-Damg√•rd iteration.
- `Padding`  Pre-processing of the byte string to be hashed.
- `RepConv` Converting between different representations of words and lists of words.
- `Types` Type-synonyms for common lists of words.
- `Test` Comparsion between this implementation and a library function. This module requires the package `Crypto.Hash.SHA256` which can be installed with `cabal install cryptohash`.

### Tools

Helper functions that are unrelated to cryptography and not specific to the project itself. For example, the `!!` function revamped to work with any `Integral` index and not just `Int`.

- `MonadRandom` Helper functions for the `MonadRandom` typeclass.
